# Schoology---Parent-Access-Code

**Description:** This google apps script will send an email to the user (parent) their student's access code for Schoology, after submitting the form.

**Instructions**
1) Create a Google Form
2) Open the connected spread sheet
3) Add in the Code.gs file

**Inspiration** I made this script to solve the problem that a parent needed to email,call, or contact a student teacher to get a parent access code. There was no way a parent could get this code on their own, on their own time. So I made this, allowing parents to get their student's access code conveniently. Saving staff time.

Code.gs - main file.
